            <h1>Goal : To become a FullStack Web Developer</h1>
            <p>I managed to learn bascic HTML and CSS. My goal is to create some functioning websites after I
                understand how to implement backend coding in my websites. As for backend programming -
                Asp.net, C#, C, Java, Python, Django, Ruby are all very good options. </p>

            <p>I have a lot to learn when it comes to software. HTML and CSS seems to be the main building blocks
                for creating a website. A website should look and perform well with proper accuracy and efficiency.

            <p>There is a lot to learn when it comes to Information Technology. As technology is advancing every day,
                software engineers must have to keep up with the changes. An employee who can't adapt and overcome
                the many obstacles that comes in coding, will eventually lose their job.</p>

            <p>
                I think I was in 6th grade when an uncle of mine suggested to my mom that I look into software
                engineering. I didn't think about it much growing up. But as the years went by and I finally finished
                highschool, the idea of studying Computer Science was the new hot topic by my peers. A
                degree in Computer Science opens doors to various job opportunities in various companies. As the job
                offers can get very lucrative, the annual salary can also get very high. But the best part is the
                versatility in this kind of work. Many professionals work from home by doing freelancing. I personally
                want to start my career by working at a reliable IT firm and learn how the world of IT works. MAybe
                after when the chance arises, I'll look into freelancing and start my own IT business. Albeit
                inconsistent
                income at first. It doesn't matter as long as I can keep all the profits to myself.

            <p>
                I legit don't know why I took IT but it's legit a highly valuable subject. The job offers pays quite a
                bit. But it's still a job if I just wanna study it. I wanna do more than just work for a company and
                make the chairman and shareholders rich. I wanna work for myself In Sha Allah. Albeit inconsistent
                income at first. It doesn't matter as long as I can keep all the profits to myself.
